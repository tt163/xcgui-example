[xcgui.dll(x64)](https://github.com/twgh/xcgui-example/blob/main/help/x64/XCGUI.dll)        [xcgui.dll(x86)](https://github.com/twgh/xcgui-example/blob/main/help/x86/XCGUI.dll)

When the program is running, you need to put "XCGUI.dll" in the program running directory.

It is best to put it in the C:\Windows\System32 directory during development, so that there is no need to put the dll in the program running directory.
